1.project Lego_brick_CNN 
dataset was taken from keggel https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joosthazelzet/lego-brick-images under the purpose of creating a convolutional network that could classify diffrent lego pieces. The model showed a 90% accuracy (with 10 epocs and a 93% accuracy with 15) on the validation Dataset the following 10% loss was from images that are difficult for even humans to classify for more information refer to the final snippit of the codelab.
